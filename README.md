# Psychic-Game

This project here is a simple letter guessing game that users can play against 'the computer' to see how many times they are able to guess the correct letter the computer is thinking of.  It was built with HTML and JavaScript, and can easily be ran by followin the hosted link.  Or by simply cloning the repo and navigating to the 'index.html' page.

This game was fairly basic to create, using basic HTML and then linking to a JavaScript page that would randomly assign a letter to the computer each round, and gives the user eight (8) guesses for each letter.  Good luck!
