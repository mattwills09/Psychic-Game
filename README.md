This game was fairly basic to create, using basic HTML and then linking the JavaScript file to the page so that would randomly assign a letter to the computer each round.  The user is given eight (8) guesses for each letter, and the score is kept for each Win and Loss.  So load it up and see how many Wins you can get!  Good luck!
